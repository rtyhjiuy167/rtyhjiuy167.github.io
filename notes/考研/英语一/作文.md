 <center><strong>How to Balance Academic Study and Extracurricular Activities</strong></center>	

​	Many students and their parents worry that spending time on extracurricular activities will hinder academic study which is understandable. But as for me, as long as we can strike a balance between them, proper participation in extracurricular activities will not only promote academic study, but also enhance our overall abilities. 

​	First of all, it’s advisable to schedule our schoolwork reasonably and finish it efficiently, because only in this way can we allocate extra time and energy to take part in extracurricular activities, which will have no negative impact on our academic study. Secondly, we should only spend time on activities we want to participate in, which will bring us enjoyment and relieve the academic pressure to some extent. Thirdly, we can also join clubs where we can meet like-minded people and improve our skills which are useful for our academic study. 

​	In a word,only by studying more efficiently and arranging extracurricular activities more rationally can we achieve a real balance between academic study and extracurricular activities.



 <center><strong>The importance of Building Trust between Employers and Employees</strong></center>		


​	It is  an undeniable  fact  that trust  can  lay  a  solid foundation for commercial activities. Therefore, building trust between employers and employees plays a crucial role in boosting an organization. 

​	To begin with, as the saying goes, the best bosses understand the art of delegation. If a boss believes in his people and  tries  his  best  to  delegate  instead  of  micromanaging,  this kind  of  belief  can  drive  him  to  create  an  environment  where employees would have more passion for work and work more efficiently. Next,  with  trust,  employers  and  employees can achieve mutual consensus，build harmonious cooperation and  have  effective  communication,  which  is  beneficial  to creating  a  pleasant  working  atmosphere.  In  this  way,  not surprisingly,  the  two  parties  can  directly  promote  the  rapid progress  of  the  organization  and  indirectly  spur  continuous development of the individuals. 

​	Taking  into  account  what  we  have  discussed above, we may safely arrive at a conclusion that it is sensible for both employers and employees to keep in mind that mutual trust contributes to realizing a win-win situation

​	建立雇员与雇主之间的信任的重要性不可否认，信任是商业活动的基石。因此，雇员与雇主之间信任的建立是促进公司发展的关键因素。

​	首先，正如俗语所说，好老板明白委托的艺术。如果一个老板信任他的员工，并且去放权而非严格管理，那么这种信任就会驱动他创造出一个雇员有更多工作热情，工作更加有效的环境。此外，有了信任，雇主与雇员之间能达成一致，建立和谐的合作关系并且能进行有效的沟通，这对于创造温馨的工作环境非常有帮助。这样一来，毫无意外，双方能够直接促进公司的发展，间接刺激个体长远的发展。

​	综上所述，我们很容易就能得出结论：对于雇主和雇员来说牢记彼此信任有助于实现双赢是明智的。
